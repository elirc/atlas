# ADR-0001: Hexagonal Architecture, Enforced by Tests

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-07-14 (Sprint 01)
- **Deciders:** [Author], [Reviewer]

## Context

Atlas's one thesis is that software is optimized for change: country rules will change,
vendors will be swapped (S12 is already scheduled to do it), and integrators will arrive with
requirements we haven't heard yet. The classic failure mode is not choosing a bad architecture —
it's choosing a good one and letting it erode, one convenient `using` at a time.

## Decision

Ports-and-adapters (hexagonal) across five projects:

| Project | Role | May reference |
|---|---|---|
| `Atlas.Domain` | entities, value objects, state machines, policies | nothing |
| `Atlas.Application` | use cases + ports (interfaces) | Domain |
| `Atlas.Contracts` | versioned DTOs — the API's public vocabulary | nothing |
| `Atlas.Infrastructure` | EF Core, adapters, dispatchers | Application, Domain |
| `Atlas.Api` | endpoints, auth, ProblemDetails, OpenAPI | Application, Contracts (+ Infrastructure **only** in `Atlas.Api.Composition`) |

**The rule is executable.** `tests/Atlas.ArchitectureTests` fails the build on any forbidden
dependency, including framework leaks into Domain and endpoints touching EF. Architecture tests
are never weakened to make a sprint compile; if they fight, the design is wrong.

Supporting decisions:

- **Use cases are classes without interfaces.** Ports (things with >1 implementation or a test
  seam: repositories, clock, FX, payments) get interfaces; use cases don't — an interface with
  one implementation and no seam consumer is ceremony.
- **The clock is injected** (`TimeProvider`) from day one.
- **Repositories + explicit `IUnitOfWork.CommitAsync`** — several writes, one transaction, and a
  seam the Sprint-10 outbox will need.
- **Modular monolith**, not microservices: boundaries enforced by tests are cheaper than
  boundaries enforced by networks, and teach the same discipline.

## Consequences

- Nine projects for a two-table walking skeleton — visible ceremony now, invoiced against S11/S12
  where change-locality is measured. The Reviewer's challenge and this bet are recorded in the
  Sprint-01 debate thread; S12's PR must show the receipt.
- Mapping code exists at every boundary (domain ↔ contract). We accept hand-written mapping; if
  it hurts, that pain is a signal worth feeling before automating.
- EF entities ARE domain entities (no separate persistence model) — the pragmatic hexagon.
  The cost: Domain classes need EF-friendly private constructors. The alternative (a full
  persistence model + mapper) buys purity we don't yet need; revisit if EF's shape ever forces a
  domain compromise beyond a private constructor.

## Rejected alternatives

- **N-tier ("Services" + "Repositories" folders in one project):** the dependency rule becomes a
  convention, and conventions erode. We want a build break, not a code-review argument.
- **Microservices:** maximal boundary enforcement, maximal operational cost; wrong trade for a
  teaching monolith and for most products this size.
- **Clean-architecture templates with MediatR + AutoMapper on day one:** every dependency must
  earn its place with a felt pain first (see CONTRIBUTING; each NuGet needs a written why).
